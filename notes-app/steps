mongodb runs on the server 27017

front end to backend we use http protocol

backend to database we make use of mongodb protocol

between frontend and database , backend is the middleware

similarly we need to set up a middleware between db and backend ------ mongodb nodejs driver is the middleware
------------------- similar one is mongoose

nodejs driver is a raw form given just like the http module

so, we make use of mongoose which is built on top of node js driver , just like express is built on top of node http module
